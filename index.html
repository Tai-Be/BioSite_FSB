            <h2>Interview With Toby</h2>

            <h3>Q: 1) Tell us about your life in Morocco before moving to the US. What was your lifestyle like?</h3>

            <p>A: Life in Morocco was laid-back, focused on family and community. I loved the food, the culture, and the close-knit atmosphere. However, I wasn't very active physically and didn't prioritize healthy eating. By the time I was 19, I weighed 205 pounds and wasn't feeling my best.</p>


            <h3>Q: 2) What motivated you to make a change when you came to the US? </h3>

            <p>A: Seeing myself in pictures and feeling sluggish made me realize I 
needed to take control of my health. I wanted to be confident and embrace this new 
chapter of my life.</p>


            <h3>Q: 3) Did you have any prior experience with fitness or healthy eating?
  </h3>
            <p>A: Not really. I played some soccer as a kid, but that was about it. 
My diet mainly consisted of traditional Moroccan dishes, which are delicious but 
often heavy in carbs and fats. I knew I needed to learn new habits and adjust to a 
healthier lifestyle.</p>


            <h3>Q: 4) What specific exercises did you incorporate into your routine? </h3>

            <p>A: I discovered a passion for tennis! Hitting the court every other 
day became my stress reliever and helped burn calories. I also joined a gym and 
started doing a combination of cardio and weight training. Swimming laps on my 
off days became another enjoyable activity, and I learned to love the feeling of 
pushing my physical limits. </p>


            <h3>Q: 5) How did you manage your diet alongside your exercise routine?</h3>

            <p>A: It wasn't easy at first. I missed my Moroccan flavors, but I 
gradually learned to adapt. I focused on lean protein, fresh fruits and vegetables, 
and whole grains. </p>


            <h3>Q: 6) Did you face any challenges or setbacks during your transformation?</h3>

            <p>A: Absolutely! There were days when I craved unhealthy food or 
felt discouraged by slow progress. But I learned to listen to my body, take rest days 
when needed, and celebrate even small victories.</p>


            <h3>Q: 7) What was the most significant change you noticed, beyond weight loss?</h3>

            <p>A: My energy levels skyrocketed! I felt stronger, more confident, 
and had a newfound appreciation for my body. </p>


            <h3>Q: 8) What advice would you give to someone looking to make a similar 
transformation?</h3>

            <p>A: Start small, be patient, and don't be afraid to experiment. Find 
activities you enjoy and prioritize consistency over perfection. Surround yourself 
with positive people who believe in you, and most importantly, listen to your body 
and trust the process. </p>


            <h3>Q: 9) How has your lifestyle and mindset changed since your transformation?</h3>

            <p>A: Fitness and healthy living have become an integral part of my 
life. I prioritize self-care, manage stress effectively, and embrace new challenges.</p>


            <h3>Q: 10) What are your future goals, health-related or otherwise?</h3>

            <p>A: I want to continue challenging myself, both physically and mentally. I'm exploring possibilities like participating in a fitness competition or pursuing a career in personal training. Ultimately, my goal is to inspire others to believe in their own potential and unlock their healthiest, happiest selves.</p>
